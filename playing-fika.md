# Playing Fika

## Getting started

This section describes the steps to create or join a Fika raid to play with your friends. Before continuing, ensure that you followed all the steps to [host your Fika server](hosting-a-fika-server/) or [join a Fika server](../installing-fika/joining-a-fika-server/).

## Hosting a raid

* Start `SPT.Launcher.exe`
* Login to your account
* Start the game
* Click `Escape From Tarkov` in the main menu
* Choose `PMC` or `SCAV`
* Choose a raid location and time phase
* Click `Next` in Practice Game Mode screen
* Click `Next` in Insurance screen
* Click `Host Raid` in Lobby screen
* Press `Start`

Once your raid is loaded, you'll see "Waiting for host to start the raid." Your friends can now see your raid in the lobby screen and join it.

When all players joined, you can start the raid by pressing `Start Raid` at the bottom.

## Joining a raid

* Start `SPT.Launcher.exe`
* Login to your account
* Start the game
* Click `Escape From Tarkov` in the main menu
* Choose `PMC` or `SCAV`
* Choose a raid location and time phase
* Click `Next` in Practice Game Mode screen
* Click `Next` in Insurance screen
* Find your friend's raid in the lobby list and click `Join`

Once your raid is loaded, you'll see "Waiting for host to start the raid." The raid will start when the host presses on `Start Raid`.

## Additional information

* You cannot join mid-raid as a PMC or SCAV. You have to join the raid before the host starts the raid.
* The raid host is providing all the AI and spawn logic. If the raid host leaves or crashes, the raid dies.
* If a player crashes, they can rejoin the raid (except the raid host).
