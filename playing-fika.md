# Playing Fika

## Getting started

This section describes the steps to create or join a Fika raid to play with your friends. Before continuing, ensure that you followed all the steps to [host your Fika server](hosting-a-fika-server/) or [join a Fika server](joining-a-fika-server/).

{% hint style="success" %}
Take a moment to verify that you and your friend(s) can see each other in the Online Players list at the main menu. If you cannot, review the steps for hosting & joining again or visit the [FAQ](faqandguides/#i-do-not-see-my-friend-s-on-the-online-players-list-on-the-main-menu-i-cannot-see-my-friends-raid-in).
{% endhint %}

## Hosting a raid

* Start `SPT.Launcher.exe`
* Login to your account
* Start the game
* Click `Escape From Tarkov` in the main menu
* Choose `PMC` or `SCAV`
* Choose a raid location and time phase
* Click `Next` in Practice Game Mode screen
* Click `Next` in Insurance screen
* Click `Host Raid` in Lobby screen
* Press `Start`

Once your raid is loaded, you'll see "Waiting for host to start the raid." Your friends can now see your raid in the lobby screen and join it.

When all players joined, you can start the raid by pressing `Start Raid` at the bottom.

## Joining a raid

* Start `SPT.Launcher.exe`
* Login to your account
* Start the game
* Click `Escape From Tarkov` in the main menu
* Choose `PMC` or `SCAV`
* Choose a raid location and time phase
* Click `Next` in Practice Game Mode screen
* Click `Next` in Insurance screen
* Find your friend's raid in the lobby list and click `Join`

Once your raid is loaded, you'll see "Waiting for host to start the raid." The raid will start when the host presses on `Start Raid`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you do not see a raid list, revisit [Installing Fika](installing-fika/).

If you do not see your friend's raid in the raid list even though they claim to have hosted one, [see this FAQ entry](faqandguides/#i-do-not-see-my-friend-s-on-the-online-players-list-on-the-main-menu-i-cannot-see-my-friends-raid-in).

If you or your friend is getting an error about verifying ports are open, [see this FAQ entry](faqandguides/#my-friend-is-getting-an-error-about-open-ports-when-trying-to-join-my-raid).
{% endhint %}

## Additional information

* You cannot join mid-raid as a PMC or SCAV. You have to join the raid before the host starts the raid.
* The raid host is providing all the AI and spawn logic. If the raid host leaves or crashes, the raid dies.
* If a player crashes or disconnects, they can attempt to rejoin the raid (except the raid host) by navigating back to the join raid screen and clicking `Join` again.
