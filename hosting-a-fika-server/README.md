# Hosting a Fika server

## Getting started

This section is dedicated to setting up Fika for hosting. There are different ways to allow players to join your server. Please read the different sections below to determine which method you will be using.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that there is some technical knowledge required to achieve this. If you absolutely have no experience, you will have a hard time. Our [Discord](https://discord.gg/project-fika) provides support in such cases.
{% endhint %}

Before continuing, make sure:

* You have followed **ALL** the steps in [Installing Fika](../installing-fika/).
* You can start the game and reach the main menu.
* You can see the Fika watermark in the bottom-left corner.
* You have **NO** other mods than Fika installed.
  * You may install mods later, but it is important to get everything working without any mods first.

## Choosing your hosting method

The preferred and officially supported way of hosting a Fika server is by port forwarding. It is by far the most efficient way for smoothest gameplay.

However due to certain network configuration or ISP restrictions, this may not be possible for you. In that case, someone else in your group should attempt to host using port forwarding. If no one is able to host using port forwarding, the alternative is to use a VPN such as Radmin VPN or ZeroTier. Keep in mind that using a free VPN service may cause instability or poor performance during gameplay.

You can also host over LAN if all players are in the same house/network.
