## Introduction

Project Fika is an unofficial SPT mod designed to enable co-op multiplayer game play with your friends in Escape from Tarkov. You can progress through quests, share items, fight AI bots (PMCs, SCAVs, and Bosses) together and much more.

The backend infrastructure (characters, inventory, quests, trading, etc.) is handled by the Escape From Tarkov backend server emulator [Single Player Tarkov (SPT)](https://sp-tarkov.com).

We strongly recommend to read the [General information](General-information.md) page to learn more about Fika.
