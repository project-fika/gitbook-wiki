## Introduction

Project Fika is a SPT mod designed to enable co-op multiplayer game play with your friends in Escape from Tarkov. You can progress through quests, share items, fight AI bots (PMCs, SCAVs, and Bosses) together and much more.

We strongly recommend to read the [General information](General-information.md) page to learn more about Fika.
