# General information

## What is Fika?

Fika is an unofficial cooperative multiplayer mod for [SPT](https://sp-tarkov.com/). Fika adds a lobby interface to join other players' raids and provide in-game networking capabilities, along with additional features that do not alter the standard Escape From Tarkov experience by default.&#x20;

In summary:

* SPT is the back-end server that allows you to start the game without using BSG servers â€” it provides the player profile, inventory, flea market, and many other Escape From Tarkov features.
* Fika is the mod component that adds cooperative multiplayer capabilities which allow players to host or join a raid to play together.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Fika is NOT an official mod for SPT. Do **NOT** contact SPT for any questions related to Fika. Instead, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/project-fika) server where you can find support for both SPT and Fika.
{% endhint %}

## Specifications

* Fika is a combination of a [BepInEx plugin](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Plugin) and a [SPT server mod](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Server).
* Fika uses SPT (with the Fika-Server plugin) as the back-end server for profile and lobby management.
* Fika uses the Client <-> Server UDP networking model for game play. While Fika is still in development, the general consensus is that network performance is better than Escape From Tarkov live (provided the host has proper networking capabilities).

## Main features

* Host your own server or join a local/external server.
* Create your own raid (or play solo).
* Join someone else's raid.
* Play together against bots, share items, progress quests together in the same raid.
* Preserve character, quest, inventory, and hideout progression.
* Use client/server mods from [SPT](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/) (some mods are not compatible - see [Limitations](General-information.md#limitations)).

## Limitations

* You cannot play Fika without owning a legitimate copy of Escape From Tarkov. You will be banned if you attempt to do so.
* There is no protection against abuse or cheating. Fika is designed to be played with trusted friends. **Hosting a public server is strongly discouraged**. We will NEVER support public servers.
* Fika does not include any PvP mechanisms. Supporting PvP is not the goal of this project.
* Fika does not offer a global matchmaking service. Only players connected to the same server can create or join raids.
* Certain SPT mods are incompatible with Fika. SPT mods are typically designed for a standard SPT installation, which does not include multiplayer functionality. It is the responsibility of the mod's author to make their mod compatible with Fika, if they choose to do so.
