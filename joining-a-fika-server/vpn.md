# VPN



{% hint style="warning" %}
Custom firewalls such as **BitDefender** may block your connection while playing. Make sure that you allow the connection or temporarily disable it while playing!
{% endhint %}

* Go to the VPN website and install the client. [Radmin](https://www.radmin.com/download/) is the recommended choice.
* Reboot your computer.
* Ensure that you can communicate with the host by pinging their VPN IP. You might need to join their channel/room first. The host will need to provide you with the channel/room information.
* Launch `SPT.Launcher.exe`.

* Enter the server's VPN address in the URL section. **DO NOT** leave out `https://`, do not forget to append the port `:6969` and do not add a slash at the end. The URL box should look like this: `https://20.21.22.23:6969`.
