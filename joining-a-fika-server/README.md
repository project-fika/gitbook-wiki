# Joining a Fika server

## Getting started

This section is dedicated for setting up Fika to join a server. The server owner must have followed all the steps in the [Hosting a Fika server](../hosting-a-fika-server/) section first before you follow the steps below.

{% hint style="info" %}
Most of the time, connection issues are caused by improper network configuration by the server owner. We cannot stress enough the importance of the server owner taking a few minutes to read the "Hosting a Fika Server" guide and following every step carefully.
{% endhint %}

Before continuing, make sure:

* You have followed **ALL** the steps in [Installing Fika](../installing-fika/).
* You can start the game and reach the main menu.
* You can see the Fika watermark in the bottom-left corner.
* You have **NO** other mods than Fika installed.
  * You may install mods later, but it is important to get everything working without any mods first.

### Setting up SPT Launcher

You must configure SPT Launcher to connect to an external SPT server. Choose one of the connection methods below. Please confirm the hosting method with the host first.

* [Standard connection](direct-connection.md) (port forwarding, LAN)
* [VPN connection](vpn.md)
